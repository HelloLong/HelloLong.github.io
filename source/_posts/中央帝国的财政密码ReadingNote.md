历史需要从三个维度看，财务、军事、统治哲学。和平时代看财务，战乱看军事，维稳靠思想控制。古今中外，对于一个集权的政府来说，最重要的有两件事情：一、建立官僚制度，控制社会；二、收税养活官僚体系。国有企业，土地共有，货币发行权是三大从民间抽税的方法。

In times of peace, finances are paramount; during conflicts, military matters take precedence; and for maintaining stability, ideological control is relied upon. Throughout history, both domestically and internationally, for a centralized government, two things are most important: first, establishing a bureaucratic system to control society; second, collecting taxes to sustain the bureaucratic system. State-owned enterprises, communal land ownership, and currency issuance constitute the three major methods of extracting taxes from the populace.
